Outputs of the first question is under
'resultsOfPart1' and 'resultsOfPart1Mat' files in the drive.
Code is in the Part1.ipynb file

Outputs of the second question is under  
'2. question\output\bsds\test\sing_scale_test' in the drive.
Code is in the Part2.ipynb file

Since the size of the zip I created is very large,
I uploaded all the files I downloaded and modified from 
github to the drive link for the second question. 
Also, the outputs of the first question can be seen on this link,

I just sent the ipynb files on ninova. Rest can be seen in the drive link.
